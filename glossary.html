  <h1>Miniature Painting Glossary</h1>
<p>I've compiled a list of technical terms relating to the hobby. I hope you find it useful.</p>
    <h2>Terms</h2>
  
    <ul class="list"><li><b>Base Coat:</b> This is the first coat of paint you put on the miniature.</li><br/>
      
<li><b>Blending:</b> the process of creating a gradient color between two paints.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Dry Brushing:</b> This is a highlighting technique. After the brush is dipped in paint, all of the medium is brushed off on a paper towel, leaving only the pigment. Then, the brush is quickly swept back and forth across a textured part of a scult.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Edge Highlight:</b> This is the process of taking the brightest color and running the side of the brush along the edges of the miniature.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Glazing:</b> This is a product as well as a technique. After you have painted and highlighted your mini, you can apply a glaze of the same color over the entire area. This will create a richer look to the mini</li><br/>

      <li><b>Highlighting:</b> This is the process of applying a lighter color over a darker color to simulate light</li><br/>

      <li><b>Layering:</b> This is the process of applying a layer of paint over another layer of paint to build up color overtime, eventually reaching a highlight.</li><br/>

      <li><b>NMM (Non-Metallic Metal):</b> This painting technique uses non-metallic colors to create a metallic looking effect.</li><br/>

      <li><b>OSL (Object Source Lighting):</b> When your mini has a light source on it, like a headlight or lightsaber, you paint the appearance of light from the source onto the miniature,<br/> creating the illusion of a lightsource.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Priming:</b> Applying a primer to your mini will help the paint stick better. Just like priming a car.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Sealer/Varnish:</b> A protective layer applied to the miniature.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Shading:</b> Applying color in some form to darken another color.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Washing:</b> A special type of paint that is very watery. </li><br/>

      <li><b>Wet Blending:</b> The process of blending two colors together when they are wet.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Wet Palette:</b> A special kind of paint palette that has a sponge in it to keep your paints from drying out.</li><br/>

      <li><b>Zenithal Lighting:</b> After the miniature has been primed you take white primer and spray the mini from above, then you go about painting as usual. The undercoat of white will cause those paints applied over it to be brighter.</li><br/>
  </ul>
