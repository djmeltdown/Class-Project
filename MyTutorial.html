<h1>How to Paint Miniatures</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>There are several pre-preparation steps such as 
<ul><ul class="my-list-style"><li>Selecting a Mini</li><br>
<li>Selecting which colors to use</li><br>
<li>Basing</li>and<br>
<li>Scraping mold lines</li>
 </ul>
  <p>
For the sake of this tutorial I've already accomplished those and will move on to the actual steps once you're ready to sit down and paint.</p>

<h2>My Method</h2>
<p>I learned this over the course of a few years by mostly watching a variety of videos on YouTube and refining my steps to achieve the
 results I want. 
These steps are by no means a concrete way painting has to be done as there are many methods. 
<ol><li>Prime the Miniature</li><br>
<li>Apply Basecoat colors</li><br>
<li>Apply Wash</li><br>
<li>Apply Highlights</li><br>
<li>Apply Special Effects</li><br>
<li>Varnish</li></ol>
<br> For me, these steps are the bare minimum amount of work I put into each figure. I think I paint just a step above table top standard, 
but not competition level. For this tutorial I have chosen to paint the <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-imperial-assault/products/rebel-saboteurs-ally-pack/">Rebel Saboteur</a> from the <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/">Fantasy Flight</a> board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault">Star Wars Imperial Assault</a> and if you would like, there is a video tutorial at the bottom of the page by YouTuber Sorastro. The paints and colors I will be using are different than his, but the process is the same.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prime the Miniature</h2>
<p>This is an important step, because without primer, paint will have a hard time adhering to the miniature. 
When priming with spray cans, make sure that you are spraying at least 10 inches away and use sweeping passes. 
Do not get up close to the mini or keep your can stationary. This will result in too much primer and will obscure 
details. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Apply Basecoat Colors</h2>
<p>After the primer has dried it's time to lay down a basecoat. 
A basecoat is the first layer of paint that you put on the miniature. 
It should be a midtone color because we will be painting over it with lighter and darker shades of the chosen color. 
We need to identify the different parts of the miniature that need to be painted and what color they will be. 
Here is a list of what I'll be using:
<ul><li>Skin: Citadel Caliban Green</li><br>
<li>Boots: Apple Barrel Black</li><br>
<li>Weapon and Goggles: Citadel Iron Hands Steel</li><br>
<li>Coat: Citadel Zandri Dust</li><br>
<li>Backpack: Citadel Death World Forest</li><br>
<li>Pants: Citadel Steel Legion Drab</li><br>
<li>Ammo Belt: Apple Barrel Black</li><br>
<li>Undershirt: Citadel Ushabti Bone</li></ul><br>
  </p>

<caption>Here you can see that the areas of the figure have been painted with a base coat. <br></caption>

<h2>Step 3: Apply Wash</h2>
<p>Once the paint has dried, it's time to move onto the wash, or shade, step. 
This is my favorite step, one because it's easy and two, because you get to see all the details of the miniature in full. 
Washes are watery pigments that are designed to flow into the recesses of the miniature. 
They create depth and shadow. They will always darken whatever you put them on, so be careful how much you apply. 
When you're just starting out you can use a black or a brown wash for the entire mini. 
As you progress, you will more than likely want to get a wash that matches the color that it is going over. 
I'll be using these washes in the following areas:
 <ul><li>Citadel Coelia Greenshade for the skin</li><br>
<li>Citadel Nuln Oil for the black boots and metallic parts</li><br>
<li>Vallejo Brown Model Wash for the pants, shirt and undershirt</li><br>
<li>Citadel Biel-Tan Green for the backpack and straps</li></ul><br>
 When using a wash it's important that you soak up any excess that you don't want. This will help with step three when we apply highlights.  </p>

<h2>Step 4: Apply Layers and Highlights</h2>
<p>Applying layers highlights is probably the most time consuming step. In this step you are applying paint to the raised areas of the mini.
 A general rule when layering and highlighting a miniature is to paint only the areas that a simulated light source would hit.
 So I will not be painting any area that should have a shadow. 
You will leave the recesses that have been darkened by the wash unpainted. The color should be a lighter shade of the basecoat. 
When you layer paints, you lay down an additional paint of a lighter shade. 
So the highlighting is painting an even smaller area of the already layered paint. 
This would be the brightest part of the miniature where the light would hit it the most. 
Note that I am not painting over the existing paint on the pants. 
They're not really the focal point of this sculpt, so I'm going to keep it darkened so as not to detract from the rest of the paint job. 
For this step I will be using: 
<ul><li>Citadel Kabalite Green and Citadel Sybarite Green for the skin</li><br>
<li>Apple Barrel Pavement for the black parts</li><br>
<li>Apple Barrel Khaki for the coat</li><br>
<li>Citadel Wraithbone for the Shirt</li><br>
<li>Citadel Runefang Steel for the metallic parts</li><br>
<li>Citadel Elysian Green and Citadel Ogryn Camo for the backpack</li></ul> </p><br>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djmeltdown/Class-Project/main/04Highlightback.JPEG" width="400" height="300" alt="layerback"><br>

<caption>As you can see here, I've painted the large, flat areas and kept the dark green outline created by the wash.<br>
</caption>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djmeltdown/Class-Project/main/05highlightback.JPEG" width="400" height="300" alt="edgeback"><br>
<p>For the highlights, you can see that I have painted my brightest colors on the edges of the the mini. This is known as Edge Highlighting</p>

<h2>Step 5: Special Effects</h2>
<p>At this step you can call the mini good. 
You do not have to this step, but I believe it sells the mini that much more as a believable paint job and it makes it look amazing. 
I'll be applying some textured paint to the base, painting the band of the base, adding some refelction to the googles and the watch, 
and adding some effects that make it look like the figure knelt or stepped in mud. 
<ul><li>Citadel Technical Lustian Undergrowth for the base</li><br>
<li>Citadel Technical Stirland Mud around the boots</li><br>
<li>Citadel Technical Typhus Corrosion on the knee</li><br>
<li>Citadel Stormhost Silver and Citadel Technical Spiritstone Red on the Goggles</li><br>
<li>Citadel Stormhost Silver and Citadel Colour Technical Tessaract Glow for the watch</li><br>
</ul><br> For the goggles and the watch, the technique here is lay down the Stormhost Silver first, then apply your colored paint over them. This will create a translucent lens or glowing effect.</ul>  </p>

I also applied the Stirland mud to the back of the book to look like he stepped in a puddle somewhere</caption>


<h2>Step 6: Varnish</h2>
<p>Finally we're done! All we have left to do is protect our beautiful work. When it comes to varnish, a matte finish is nessary. Spray it in the same way you sprayed the primer on, but for this step, it doesn't really matter if it pools anywhere. The varnish should dry clear in about 15 minutes. Now you can display your new piece of art! </p><br>
