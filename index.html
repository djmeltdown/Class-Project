<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>One thing that people notice about me is that I have <b>many</b> hobbies. In the past, I've been a full time DJ, taught myself how to cook authentic Japanese ramen, done photography, and dabbled in pottery.<br> These days I spend most of my spare time keeping up with new designer board games and activities surrounding that. I spend a lot of time on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">Board Game Geek</a>.<br>
I mention board games as my main hobby, because the two main activities that take up my spare time are done in support of them.<br> Currently, 3D Printing board game inserts and upgrades, and painting 28mm miniatures are my two main hobbies.<br> They kind of go hand in hand, since I paint what I print.</p>

<p>For 3D Printing I use a Creality Ender 3 Pro.I've upgraded it with an auto bed-leveling sensor, glass print bed, and metal extruder.<br> Also, all the orange parts are things I've printed and added to the machine!</p>

<p>I get all of my files off of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>. <br>If you can think of something, chances are someone's already designed it so all you have to do is print it!</p>
<p>The main thing I've been printing over the last 6 months are dungeon tiles for <a href= "https://www.dndbeyond.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. <br>Each square is 1 inch and represents 5 feet of floor in the dungeon.
 Miniatures will be placed on the squares and follow rules for movement</p>

<p>Here's an example of the miniatures that I paint.Their bases are 1 inch in diameter and fit perfectly!</p></a>

<p>Now, you've probably noticed that all of the things I've shown you are painted! WELL, let's just say I've gone a little crazy in that arena.</p>

<p>That's 120 <b>DIFFERENT</b> paint colors on those racks and that's not even all of them!<br>There's others on a different rack (not pictured here) and there's more in a drawer AND this doesn't even inlcude spray paints!</p>
<p> Lastly, let's zoom out a little more so you can see the entire workstation.</P>

<p>More dungeon pieces! In addition to floors, there's also walls and doors. Looks like I've got a lot of painting ahead of me!</p>
