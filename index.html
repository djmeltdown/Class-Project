<h1>Chris Guild's HTML Learning Page</h1>
This page has been created by Chris Guild for Southwestern College CPT 422 HTML course on 2/23/2021.<br>
This page will serve as a portfolio for course work over the next six weeks.<br>
The code on this page so far is simple heading brackets and breaks. 
<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
I will be buidling on this page by adding more about myself, adding links, and adding pictures.
