<p>Welcome to my page! I hope you enjoy your visit as you navigate around the site. I hoping this will be a useful resource for those that are interesting in getting<br>
started. Please visit the gallery to see some of my work, or check out the useful links page if you want recommendations on painting supplies. There is also a glossary<br>
full of technical terms that related to the hobby.</p>
